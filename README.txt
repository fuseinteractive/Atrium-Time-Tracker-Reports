This is a Feature specifically for Open Atrium and the Time Tracker 
(drupal.org/project/time_tracker) module.

To enable goto admin/build/modules and enable as you would a module.

Once enabled you will have the following:

  - A new view (time_tracker/atrium_reports)
      This new view extends the original time tracker reporting page
      (time_tracker/reports) and adds a filter for atrium groups.
      The new groups filter will also auto fill the Projects filter
      with projects from the chosen group.
